                <h1>What is Quiz Bowl?</h1>
                <p>Quiz Bowl is most completely described as a "team-based knowledge game."</p>

                <h3>Team-Based</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of any Quiz Bowl game, two teams sit opposite each other in front of a moderator. The moderator begins the first tossup-bonus cycle by reading a "tossup." The first person to buzz in and answer correctly will score their team points based on how early they've answered. </p>
                <p>If a team answers a tossup correctly, they will receive points depending on how early they answer. At the beginning of the question, a team will be rewarded 15 points for a correct answer. However, after the moderator reads past something called the "power mark," they will only be rewarded 10 points. An incorrect answer before the end of the question will cause the team which answered incorrectly to lose 5 points, but an incorrect answer after the end of the question has no penalty. Each team can only answer once per tossup, so if someone answers incorrectly, that person's team cannot answer that tossup anymore. Teams may not communicate during a tossup.</p>
                <p>After a team answers correctly, the moderator will read a "bonus" to them. Bonus questions are three-part questions that only the team receiving them can answer. Members of a team receiving a bonus may discuss among themselves in order to answer the bonusâ€”this makes effective team communication crucial to answering bonuses correctly.</p>

                <h3>Knowledge</h3>
                <p>The questions in any given game might include, but are not limited to: history, literature, science, fine arts, geography, religion, philosophy, and pop culture. A single game will almost certainly include questions from each of these categories and more.</p>

                <h3>Game</h3>
                <p>As Quiz Bowl player Malin Sapkota once said, "Quiz Bowl is a relaxed but also competitive activity where I can have fun and learn more about all subjects." Quiz Bowl is a fantastic way to have fun by yourself or with friends.</p>
